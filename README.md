Suggestive guidelines for pipelines at every scale

> This document is in its infancy... feel free to help contribute and make sense of it all :) 


## Summary
Pipeline is a very loose term and often redefined by each entity's needs.  This document is intended to provide a checklist of needs for varing scales of teams and production.

This documentation should be used both as a reference for pipeline teams and a guide for non-technical folks to understand the concepts and importance of standards and pipeline design.


## Production Scale Examples
- 1 person
- 3 people
- 10 people
- 20 people
- 50 people
- 200-300 people
- 300-2000 people

- How many locations?
  - How many timezones?
